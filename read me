* test uart receive and transmit data by using interrupt 

- this project used for test the receive and transmit data on USART2 using interrupt
- this exxample is tested and it's work proprly
- this exmpale can receive a maximum of 10 data, when it reached the 
	max will transmit that data again.
- this example is tested 

__example 
___send : 1234567890
___receive: 1234567890
 
 
 
 definition: 
 + defien usart on the cubemx (baudrate: 115200, oversampling 8 ...)
 + in the main we call MX_USART2_UART_Init(); and this HAL_UART_Receive_IT(&huart2,(uint8_t *)&data,1);
 + i use callback function when receive data each time the uart receive a bytethis function called
 + each time i need to call this function HAL_UART_Receive_IT(&huart2,(uint8_t *)&data,1); to restart receiving interrupt
 + when i have received 10 bytes i will call this function to transmit dagta received  HAL_UART_Transmit_IT(&huart2,(uint8_t *)&recv_data,10);
